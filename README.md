# Final-Application

This project is based around creating an easy to use UI for restaurant staff to avail of in order to establish a more fluent, versitile experience when working with dockets. The aim is to automate paper dockets digitally for any hotel or restaurant to use, eleviating confusion and clutter within the kitchen, line forming around tables by waiting staff and enabling customers to recieve their meals more timely.

As a team project, the tasks were split amongst 5 team members to increase efficiancy as follows: 
  1. Tosin = Login Screen
  2. Conor = Chef Screen
  3. Eoin = Waitress Screen
  4. Sean = Choice Screen
  5. Connal = Management Screen
  
On completion of the project, each section had been completed by the following group members:
  1. Login Screen: Tosin & Conor
  2. Choice screen: Sean & Tosin
  3. Management Screen: Tosin, Conor
  4. Waiting Staff Screen: Eoin & Conor
  5. Chef Screen: Conor

Each group member's problems encountered can be found within the Problems repository.

The project was delivered on time and worked as expected, though much work is needed for total satisfaction and completion. Some future iterations can include but is not limited to the following:
  1. Create a dynamic website, or perhaps even changing to an Android or IOS application.
  2. Adding bootstrap to allow fluidity on mobile devices.
  3. Building a register page to act as a cash register replacement for order totals.
  4. Extending chef screen and allowing chefs to grey out menu items that are out of stock/ unable to be made.
  5. Creating a section in the waiting staff screen for entering numbers of customers a table had and recorded value for total served.
  6. Allow login screen to send verification emails to new users.
  7. Re-doing the management navbar for better ease of use by the user.
  8. Enhancing the UI for a better UX visually.
  9. Making popups on chef display for specific orders (steaks will show well-done, rare, etc. as well as sides like salad and chips)
  10. Enhancing popups for errors and creating error pages (Error 404, etc.)
